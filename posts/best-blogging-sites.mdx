## Frequently Asked Questions about Blog Publishing

### What are the benefits of blogging?

People can express their opinions, share their experiences, and publish their articles with others. With the development of technology, many platforms have emerged that allow individuals to create their blogs.

#### The act of writing makes you think better

Writing forces you to express your thoughts in a more organized and structured way. This helps to clarify your thinking and can often lead to new insights and ideas. Additionally, writing helps to build your memory and recall, which can help you to better articulate your thoughts and ideas.

#### It helps you to understand a topic better

Writing forces you to take a step back and think critically about a topic, to structure your thoughts in a more organized way and to make connections between ideas. By writing down your thoughts, you are able to process them and gain a better understanding of the topic, which can lead to new ideas and insights.

#### Increase your authority

By blogging about a particular topic, you can establish yourself as an expert in the field. This will help you to build credibility with your audience and gain trust from your readers, which can lead to more opportunities.

#### Make your customers happy and get more leads

#### Free Marketing

It is important to know that well-planned and SEO-optimized blog posts will drive traffic to your website and increase the authority of your website (in the context of SEO).

Additionally, increased traffic will increase your chances of converting visitors into customers. According to HubSpot research, 60% of marketers cite Inbound Marketing (SEO, blog content, etc.) as their top lead source.

### What you need for blogging?

The requirements is depend on the blog site you need. You need two things in general to start blogging. Those are :

- A blogging platform (Free/Paid)
- Domain name (optional)

Let me explain more: If you have decided to create a blog site, doing it with your own domain name will cause your site to have a much more professional appearance.

To elaborate further, the majority of blog creation websites that are mentioned below will provide you with a subdomain when you first sign up.

For example, if you sign up for WebFlow, a domain similar to cbsofyalioglu.webflow.com will be allocated to you. However, what we need is a domain name like http://cbsofyalioglu.com.

#### Where can I get a domain name?

There are many addresses available for you to get a domain name. The popular ones are:

- [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) (My favourite)
- [I want my name](https://iwantmyname.com/)
- [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com)

## Blogging Platforms

When choosing a blogging platform, it's important to consider the type of blog you want to create and the features that are important to you. Some platforms are better suited for certain types of blogs, while others offer more flexibility in terms of design and customization options.

### 1. [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/)

![Blogging site: Wordpress](/posts/wordpress.webp)

WordPress is the most popular blog platform in the world. It is easy to use and allows users to create a website in minutes. There are many templates and plug-ins available that allow users to customize their website according to their preferences.

---

### 2. [Webflow](https://webflow.grsm.io/gr15bvbdlvfo)

![Blogging site: Webflow](/posts/webflow.webp)

If good design is the most important variable to you, then WebFlow is the perfect platform for you.

WebFlow is the most customizable website builder on the list. The limit to what you can do with WebFlow is only restricted by your own imagination.

I must admit that it is not an easy platform for beginners. However, the WebFlow Academy provides you with many tutorial videos, both in written and video format. Even when you have examined the documentation and tutorial videos, you will be convinced that they were produced by designers.

<Video

    download={false}
/>

Additionally, it allows you to export the code that you create. In this sense, you can host the code of your design for free on a JAMStack website.

it is the best platform for people who want to create unique designs with an ultra-advanced web editor and animation editor.

It is also worth mentioning that it has built-in Lottie animation support.

Thanks to its powerful content management system, you can customize your blog posts on your website with the designs you want.

In other words, you can apply all kinds of high-end designs that you can do on web pages to your blog posts as well.

### 3. [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/)

![Blogging site: Blogger](/posts/blogger.webp)

There are many blogging sites out there, but Blogger is one of the most popular. Using a subdomain name allows you to use it for free.

It was acquired by Google in 2003.

The editor is relatively advanced, and there are options such as allowing comments on blogs.

With a limited number of themes to choose from, I find it difficult to customize.

Connecting your Google Adsense account also lets you earn income from ads.

(You need to attract a considerable amount of traffic for this).

---

### 4. [Medium](https://medium.com/)

![Blogging site: Medium](/posts/medium.webp)

Medium is a platform that allows users to create blogs and share their stories. It is a great platform for writers, bloggers, and journalists. Users can also follow other writers and read their articles.

---

### 5. [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/)

![Blogging site: Tumblr](/posts/tumblr.webp)

Tumblr is a micro-blogging platform that allows users to share their thoughts, images, and videos. It is easy to use and allows users to customize their blog with different themes.

Tumblr, one of the oldest blog sites, was acquired by Automattic, the developer of the WordPress application, which is among the best blog sites in 2019.

---

### 6. [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/)

<iframe

    title="Keanu Reeves | Squarespace"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
></iframe>

Squarespace is a website builder that allows users to create a website or blog. It is easy to use and has many templates and features available. It also has a built-in e-commerce platform that allows users to sell their products directly from their website.

We can safely say that New York-based Square Space is not only one of the most popular blogging sites, but also one of the best website building platforms. Squarespace will always be at the top of the list of best sites to start a blog.

They previously featured Keanu Reeves in their commercials. I wanted to share it here too, after all, it's my blog.

SquareSpace, which is always among the best blog sites, generally performs well under almost every title.

All other features aside, it has the most advanced content editor on this list.

We know that interactive content is gaining more and more importance.

I care about the richness that being able to add many elements such as carousel galleries, grid sections, data tables and calendar to the blog post will add to our articles.

In general, such blogging sites also offer a free plan for users. It only uses subdomains or contains ads.

One of the downsides of this platform is that it doesn't have a free plan and only allows a 14-day trial.

After the 14-day free trial period, you can continue your blog or website with a package of at least $12.

It is worth mentioning that I occasionally encounter situations such as not loading pages on the website. Maybe it is personal.

In addition, you can only customize the templates presented to you in terms of design.

Having a total of over 70 ready-made website templates seems like a good deal, but it could be more.

---

### 7. [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)

![blog yazma sitesi Wix](/posts/wix.webp)


Wix is another website builder that allows users to create a website or blog. It is easy to use and has many templates and features available. It also has a built-in e-commerce platform that allows users to sell their products directly from their website.

Another site that should definitely be among the best blogging sites is Wix. In spite of the negative comments of recent years, Wix has turned out to be a platform that listens to its users and responds appropriately to their needs.

As far as price-performance is concerned, this blog site is the best on the market.

One of Wix's weaknesses is performance. We'll take you to another platform if you're concerned about SEO.

It also has more than 500 ready-made templates and you can use them for free.

It has 3 editors, including the normal editor and EditorX, in addition to its artificial intelligence supported editor.


---

It will be updated as soon as possible.

Ultimately, the best blogging platform for you will depend on your individual needs and preferences. It's important to take the time to research different platforms and experiment with them to find the one that works best for you. With the right platform and a bit of creativity, anyone can create a successful and engaging blog.
