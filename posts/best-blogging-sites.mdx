## Frequently Asked Questions about Blog Publishing

### What are the benefits of blogging?

People can express their opinions, share their experiences, and publish their articles with others. With the development of technology, many platforms have emerged that allow individuals to create their blogs.

#### The act of writing makes you think better

Writing forces you to express your thoughts in a more organized and structured way. This helps to clarify your thinking and can often lead to new insights and ideas. Additionally, writing helps to build your memory and recall, which can help you to better articulate your thoughts and ideas.

#### It helps you to understand a topic better

Writing forces you to take a step back and think critically about a topic, to structure your thoughts in a more organized way and to make connections between ideas. By writing down your thoughts, you are able to process them and gain a better understanding of the topic, which can lead to new ideas and insights.

#### Increase your authority

By blogging about a particular topic, you can establish yourself as an expert in the field. This will help you to build credibility with your audience and gain trust from your readers, which can lead to more opportunities.

#### Make your customers happy and get more leads

#### Free Marketing

It is important to know that well-planned and SEO-optimized blog posts will drive traffic to your website and increase the authority of your website (in the context of SEO).

Additionally, increased traffic will increase your chances of converting visitors into customers. According to HubSpot research, 60% of marketers cite Inbound Marketing (SEO, blog content, etc.) as their top lead source.

- **AI Blog**: An AI blog is a blog about artificial intelligence topics and advancements. It covers topics such as machine learning, natural language processing and robots. The content often comes from news sources, tech journals, industry insiders, and experts in the field of AI. AI blogs are great for keeping up to date on the latest advances in AI and exploring the potential implications of AI technologies. With an AI blog, you can partake in discussions and gain a deeper understanding of the technology, which will help you understand how it can be used in various industries, such as healthcare, transportation, finance, and more.

In addition to the types of blogs mentioned above, there are many other variations that exist. For example, political blogs, personal blogs, sports blogs, and technology blogs are just a few examples of the diverse range of blogs that are available online.

### What you need for blogging?

The requirements is depend on the blog site you need. You need two things in general to start blogging. Those are :

- A blogging platform (Free/Paid)
- Domain name (optional)

Let me explain more: If you have decided to create a blog site, doing it with your own domain name will cause your site to have a much more professional appearance.

To elaborate further, the majority of blog creation websites that are mentioned below will provide you with a subdomain when you first sign up.

For example, if you sign up for WebFlow, a domain similar to cbsofyalioglu.webflow.com will be allocated to you. However, what we need is a domain name like http://cbsofyalioglu.com.

#### Where can I get a domain name?

There are many addresses available for you to get a domain name. The popular ones are:

- [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) (My favourite)
- [I want my name](https://iwantmyname.com/)
- [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com)

![Ultimate list of blogging sites](/posts/en-iyi-blog-yazma-siteleri.webp)

## Pupoular Blogging Platforms

When choosing a blogging platform, it's important to consider the type of blog you want to create and the features that are important to you. Some platforms are better suited for certain types of blogs, while others offer more flexibility in terms of design and customization options.

### 1. [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/)

![Blogging site: Wordpress](/posts/wordpress.webp)

WordPress is the most popular blog platform in the world. It is easy to use and allows users to create a website in minutes. There are many templates and plug-ins available that allow users to customize their website according to their preferences.

---

### 2. [Webflow](https://webflow.grsm.io/gr15bvbdlvfo)

![Blogging site: Webflow](/posts/webflow.webp)

If good design is the most important variable to you, then WebFlow is the perfect platform for you.

WebFlow is the most customizable website builder on the list. The limit to what you can do with WebFlow is only restricted by your own imagination.

I must admit that it is not an easy platform for beginners. However, the WebFlow Academy provides you with many tutorial videos, both in written and video format. Even when you have examined the documentation and tutorial videos, you will be convinced that they were produced by designers.

<Video
    cover="/posts/video/webflow-animasyon.webp"
    src="https://cbsofyalioglu.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/archive/webflow-animation.mp4"
    download={false}
/>

Additionally, it allows you to export the code that you create. In this sense, you can host the code of your design for free on a JAMStack website.

it is the best platform for people who want to create unique designs with an ultra-advanced web editor and animation editor.

It is also worth mentioning that it has built-in Lottie animation support.

Thanks to its powerful content management system, you can customize your blog posts on your website with the designs you want.

In other words, you can apply all kinds of high-end designs that you can do on web pages to your blog posts as well.

---

### 3. [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/)

![Blogging site: Blogger](/posts/blogger.webp)

There are many blogging sites out there, but Blogger is one of the most popular. Using a subdomain name allows you to use it for free.

It was acquired by Google in 2003.

The editor is relatively advanced, and there are options such as allowing comments on blogs.

With a limited number of themes to choose from, I find it difficult to customize.

Connecting your Google Adsense account also lets you earn income from ads.

(You need to attract a considerable amount of traffic for this).

---

### 4. [Medium](https://medium.com/)

![Blogging site: Medium](/posts/medium.webp)

Medium is a platform that allows users to create blogs and share their stories. It is a great platform for writers, bloggers, and journalists. Users can also follow other writers and read their articles.

---

### 5. [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/)

![Blogging site: Tumblr](/posts/tumblr.webp)

Tumblr is a micro-blogging platform that allows users to share their thoughts, images, and videos. It is easy to use and allows users to customize their blog with different themes.

Tumblr, one of the oldest blog sites, was acquired by Automattic, the developer of the WordPress application, which is among the best blog sites in 2019.

---

### 6. [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/)

<iframe
    width="700"
    height="315"
    src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Tf_OhHiAy0M"
    title="Keanu Reeves | Squarespace"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
></iframe>

Squarespace is a website builder that allows users to create a website or blog. It is easy to use and has many templates and features available. It also has a built-in e-commerce platform that allows users to sell their products directly from their website.

We can safely say that New York-based Square Space is not only one of the most popular blogging sites, but also one of the best website building platforms. Squarespace will always be at the top of the list of best sites to start a blog.

They previously featured Keanu Reeves in their commercials. I wanted to share it here too, after all, it's my blog.

SquareSpace, which is always among the best blog sites, generally performs well under almost every title.

All other features aside, it has the most advanced content editor on this list.

We know that interactive content is gaining more and more importance.

I care about the richness that being able to add many elements such as carousel galleries, grid sections, data tables and calendar to the blog post will add to our articles.

In general, such blogging sites also offer a free plan for users. It only uses subdomains or contains ads.

One of the downsides of this platform is that it doesn't have a free plan and only allows a 14-day trial.

After the 14-day free trial period, you can continue your blog or website with a package of at least $12.

It is worth mentioning that I occasionally encounter situations such as not loading pages on the website. Maybe it is personal.

In addition, you can only customize the templates presented to you in terms of design.

Having a total of over 70 ready-made website templates seems like a good deal, but it could be more.

---

### 7. [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)

![blog yazma sitesi Wix](/posts/wix.webp)


Wix is another website builder that allows users to create a website or blog. It is easy to use and has many templates and features available. It also has a built-in e-commerce platform that allows users to sell their products directly from their website.

Another site that should definitely be among the best blogging sites is Wix. In spite of the negative comments of recent years, Wix has turned out to be a platform that listens to its users and responds appropriately to their needs.

As far as price-performance is concerned, this blog site is the best on the market.

One of Wix's weaknesses is performance. We'll take you to another platform if you're concerned about SEO.

It also has more than 500 ready-made templates and you can use them for free.

It has 3 editors, including the normal editor and EditorX, in addition to its artificial intelligence supported editor.

---

### 8. [PageCloud](https://pagecloud.grsm.io/zzgyyp0eb7j5)

![Blogging site: PageCloud](/posts/pagecloud.webp)

In terms of positioning itself, Pagecloud is suitable for SMEs. Additionally, it offers a blogging function in addition to being a website creation app for your company or shop.

An easy-to-use interface is provided by this application, which also includes an e-commerce module. Your blog posts can be published on your website by using the Pagecloud blog application, which is very simple and easy to use.

The price of membership in Pagecloud begins at $19 per month for those who are interested in [becoming a member of PageCloud](https://pagecloud.grsm.io/zzgyyp0eb7j5).

---

### 9. [Medium](https://medium.com/)

![Blogging site: Medium](/posts/medium.webp)

Several of us are familiar with Medium, which was founded by the co-founders of Twitter and Blogger.

Despite the limitations of the interface and design modification options, the product is very well suited for the blogging business.

If you are reading an article on Medium, you may be asked to upgrade to a paid subscription. The reason for this is that it allows writers to earn a living through their writing.

The articles you share can be presented as free or paid impressions. In this way, you will earn income when your articles are read by users who have subscribed to a payment plan.

We can call this system a paywall (I think we can call it a payment wall). A warning will appear when ordinary users attempt to read more than the set number of articles per month.

If the article is not set free by the owner, users cannot read it. But this is a soft paywall.

#### How do I read posts on Medium?

Simply open the same page in an incognito tab if you have reached your Medium article reading limit.

It is not possible for Medium to keep track of how many articles you have read. Nevertheless, even if he records it, he will not know that you are reading it.

A cookie or browser storage area is used to keep track of the number of reads. Consequently, if you open your browser in an incognito tab or delete cookies, your reading limit will be reset.

---

### 10. [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)

![Blogging site: Ghost](/posts/ghost.webp)

Ghost is an open source blog site that is popular among developers and writers. Its stars on GitHub indicate its popularity.

The most impressive feature of this platform, which is very popular with writers and programmers, is the content editor. In addition to having an embed button for a variety of platforms, this editor is also capable of working in markdown.

The bookmark tool is my favorite feature among all of these. You may also share your links as previews if you wish.

You can greatly enhance your blog's functionality with a variety of third-party integrations.

You may find the customization possibilities limited if you are not familiar with programming. A ready-made theme can be used in this situation. It is possible to find 40 - 50 free Ghost themes on the Internet. The cost of premium themes ranges from $49 to $89 per year.

On to the price part: Ghost's blog costs $29 if it is hosted on Ghost.org. As it is an open source project, you are free to customize your blog as you please, and you can host it wherever you wish. Alternatives that are less expensive are very likely to be found.

The fourth version of Ghost blogging site has brought a number of improvements and conveniences. Additionally, the $29 price mentioned above has been changed. A subscription to Ghost blog now costs $9 per year. The Ghost blogging platform has become very reasonable as a result of this.

---

### 11. [Tilda](https://tilda.cc/)

![Blogging site: Tilda](/posts/tilda.webp)

Blogging on Tilda is quite easy. You can write and edit blog posts with its visual editor, add images and videos, and share links to social media. You can also create custom web blocks and templates to give your blog a unique look, and you can use the CRM application to manage your customers and orders. Plus, you can export your code with an upper package to use on other platforms.

---

### 12. [Studio](https://studio.design)

![Blogging site: Studio](/posts/studio.webp)

Studio is a website creation platform based in Japan. The platform is very fast, and the user interface is almost awesome. As for the disadvantages, they allow you to publish up to 5 blog articles even in their $9 package. Consequently, we reach the $27 plan, the most expensive plan on this list. Corporate organizations may find this service to be ideal. In other words, it is more suitable for company blogs.

---

### 13. [Voog](https://www.voog.com/)

![Blogging site: Voog](/posts/voog.webp)

Among the features that Voog, a website builder, offers are those necessary to produce a well-written blog post. It is comparable to platforms such as Wix, Squarespace, and WordPress in this respect.

A free plan is available for this blog app, but the lowest plan costs between 8 and 11 euros. Blogging on the Voog platform is easy to use and provides a range of features for creating a professional-looking blog. It allows you to customize your blog with a range of themes and includes features such as adding images and videos, creating a comment section, and connecting to social media accounts.

---

### 14. [Strikingly](https://www.strikingly.com/)

![Blogging site: Strikingly](/posts/strikingly.webp)

Strikingly is a website building platform just like Wix and Squarespace. Although it has less features than its alternatives, it is among the free blog sites that you can use with a subdomain.

---

### 15. [Webnode](https://us.webnode.com/)

![Blogging site: Webnode](/posts/webnode.webp)

Blogging on the WebNode platform is simple and straightforward. You can customize the look of your blog, add posts, and upload images. You can also connect your blog to social media accounts, like Twitter and Facebook, and use SEO tools to get more exposure.

There is no free version of Webnode, but it does offer a reasonably priced $3.9 plan. Using Webnode, you can open a blog, an e-commerce site, or a company website. There is no free plan available with this blog app, so the lowest plan ranges from 8 - 11 euros.

---

### 16. [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/app/blog)

![Blogging site: Odoo](/posts/odoo-blog-1391x800.webp)

I would describe Odoo as an open source business suite. CRM, Purchasing, Contracts, Employee Tracking, Blog Writing, etc., are just a few of the applications included in this application suite.

The blog is the part of these applications that we are currently interested in. Furthermore, if you intend to use Odoo only for blogging, it is free.

In spite of the fact that I am not able to say it catches the current trends for its ready-made templates, I believe it deserves to be considered among the best free blogging sites.

---

### 17. [Ucraft](https://frstre.com/go/?a=35975-862da9&s=2633405-7f7428)

![Blogging site: Ucraft](/posts/ucraft.webp)

This platform was originated in Russia and has offices in three countries, including the United States. A number of e-commerce services are also offered by UCraft. Thus, it is suitable for bloggers who intend to sell their products. Although it is less well known than other examples, we can say that it is a suitable option for beginners who wish to start a blog.

With the lowest paid package of $10, you will be able to use the e-commerce service.


---

### 18. [Unicorn Platform](https://unicornplatform.com/)

![Blogging site: Unicorn](/posts/unicorn.webp)


Unicorn Platform is a drag-and-drop website and blog builder for startups, mobile apps, and software as a service providers. It promotes itself as a no-code website builder.

With the $8 plan, you can create a blog with your own domain name, or you can export code with the $18 plan.

Among the apps on this list, Publii is one of the most exclusive. In other words, it is a blog publishing software that can work offline. In order to use it, you must install it on your computer. Next, you determine the theme and other aesthetic elements of the interior. You can then begin writing your blog post using this application that is equipped with three excellent editors. Not only can you create blog posts, but you can also create documentation sites and questions and answers pages.

Then you upload these static files to a server or upload them as a JAMStack site. It is especially recommended that you upload via Netlify. Publii makes it both easy and free to register.

---

### 2. [HashNode](https://hashnode.com/@canburaks/joinme)

There is no doubt that HashNode is one of the best free blogging sites on the internet where you can use your own domain name as well.

One of the channels where software developers share and follow each other is HashNode.

It deserves to be included on this list despite the fact that it does not provide much visual customization.
