# List of Blogging Sites

## Popular Blogging Sites

When choosing a blogging platform, it's important to consider the type of blog you want to create and the features that are important to you. Some platforms are better suited for certain types of blogs, while others offer more flexibility in terms of design and customization options.

This section includes some of **the most popular blogging sites** and the popularity used here is a subjective manner.

### 1. [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/)

![WordPress homepage](/posts/wordpress.webp)

<TagList>

WordPress is **the most popular blogging site** in the world. It is easy to use and allows users to create a website in minutes. There are many templates and plug-ins available that allow users to customize their website according to their preferences.

### 2. [Webflow](https://webflow.grsm.io/gr15bvbdlvfo)

<TagList>
    <Tag color="blue">

        cloneable themes
    </Tag>
    <Tag color="mint">
        code export
    </Tag>
</TagList>

If good design is the most important variable to you, then WebFlow is the perfect **publishing platform for you**.

WebFlow is the most customizable website builder on the list. The limit to what you can do with WebFlow is only restricted by your own imagination.

I must admit that it is not an easy platform for beginners. However, the WebFlow Academy provides you with many tutorial videos, both in written and video format. Even when you have examined the documentation and tutorial videos, you will be convinced that they were produced by designers.

/>

Additionally, it allows you to export the code that you create. In this sense, you can host the code of your design for free on a JAMStack website.

it is the best platform for people who want to create unique designs with an ultra-advanced web editor and animation editor.

It is also worth mentioning that it has built-in Lottie animation support.

Thanks to its powerful content management system, you can customize your blog posts on your website with the designs you want.

In other words, you can apply all kinds of high-end designs that you can do on web pages to your blog posts as well.

You just need to [create an account in WebFlow](https://webflow.grsm.io/gr15bvbdlvfo).

### 3. [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/)

![Blogger homepage](/posts/blogger.webp)

<TagList>
    <Tag color="blue">
        easy integrations with Google products
    </Tag>
</TagList>

There are many blogging sites out there, but Blogger is one of the most popular. Using a subdomain name allows you to use it for free.

It was acquired by Google in 2003.

The editor is relatively advanced, and there are options such as allowing comments on blogs.

With a limited number of themes to choose from, I find it difficult to customize.

Connecting your Google Adsense account also lets you earn income from ads.

(You need to attract a considerable amount of traffic for this).

### 5. [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/)

![Blogging site: Tumblr](/posts/tumblr.webp)

<TagList>
    <Tag color="blue">
        micro-blogging
    </Tag>
</TagList>

Tumblr is a **micro-blogging site** that allows users to share their thoughts, images, and videos. It is easy to use and allows users to customize their blog with different themes.

Tumblr, one of the oldest blog sites, was acquired by Automattic, the developer of the WordPress application, which is among the best blog sites in 2019.

---

### 6. [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/)

<TagList>
    <Tag color="blue">
        carefully curated themes
    </Tag>
</TagList>

Squarespace is a website builder that allows users to create a website or blog. It is easy to use and has many templates and features available. It also has a built-in e-commerce platform that allows users to sell their products directly from their website.

We can safely say that New York-based Square Space is not only one of the most popular blogging sites, but also one of the best website building platforms. Squarespace will always be at the top of the list of best sites to start a blog.

They previously featured Keanu Reeves in their commercials. I wanted to share it here too, after all, it's my blog.

SquareSpace, which is always among the best blog sites, generally performs well under almost every title.

All other features aside, it has the most advanced content editor on this list.

We know that interactive content is gaining more and more importance.

I care about the richness that being able to add many elements such as carousel galleries, grid sections, data tables and calendar to the blog post will add to our articles.

In general, such blogging sites also offer a free plan for users. It only uses subdomains or contains ads.

One of the downsides of this platform is that it doesn't have a free plan and only allows a 14-day trial.

After the 14-day free trial period, you can continue your blog or website with a package of at least $12.

It is worth mentioning that I occasionally encounter situations such as not loading pages on the website. Maybe it is personal.

In addition, you can only customize the templates presented to you in terms of design.

Having a total of over 70 ready-made website templates seems like a good deal, but it could be more.

### 7. [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)

![blog yazma sitesi Wix](/posts/wix.webp)

<TagList>
    <Tag color="blue">
        the most economical option
    </Tag>
    <Tag color="sky">
        highly extendible
    </Tag>
    <Tag color="cyan">
        beginner friendly
    </Tag>
</TagList>

Wix is another website builder that allows users to create a website or blog. It is easy to use and has many templates and features available. It also has a built-in e-commerce platform that allows users to sell their products directly from their website.

Another site that should definitely be among the best blogging sites is Wix. In spite of the negative comments of recent years, Wix has turned out to be a platform that listens to its users and responds appropriately to their needs.

As far as price-performance is concerned, this blog site is the best on the market.

One of Wix's weaknesses is performance. We'll take you to another platform if you're concerned about SEO.

It also has more than 500 ready-made templates and you can use them for free.

It has 3 editors, including the normal editor and EditorX, in addition to its artificial intelligence supported editor.

### 8. [PageCloud](https://pagecloud.grsm.io/zzgyyp0eb7j5)

![PageCloud homepage](/posts/pagecloud.webp)

<TagList>
    <Tag color="blue">
        beginner friendly
    </Tag>
</TagList>

In terms of positioning itself, Pagecloud is suitable for SMEs. Additionally, it offers a blogging function in addition to being a website creation app for your company or shop.

An easy-to-use interface is provided by this application, which also includes an e-commerce module. Your blog posts can be published on your website by using the Pagecloud blog application, which is very simple and easy to use.

The price of membership in Pagecloud begins at $19 per month for those who are interested in [becoming a member of PageCloud](https://pagecloud.grsm.io/zzgyyp0eb7j5).

### 9. [Medium](https://medium.com/)

![Blogging site: Medium](/posts/medium.webp)

<TagList>
    <Tag color="blue">
        beginner friendly
    </Tag>
    <Tag color="sky">
        paywall option
    </Tag>
</TagList>

Several of us are familiar with Medium, which was founded by the co-founders of Twitter and Blogger.

Despite the limitations of the interface and design modification options, the product is very well suited for the blogging business.

If you are reading an article on Medium, you may be asked to upgrade to a paid subscription. The reason for this is that it allows writers to earn a living through their writing.

The articles you share can be presented as free or paid impressions. In this way, you will earn income when your articles are read by users who have subscribed to a payment plan.

We can call this system a paywall (I think we can call it a payment wall). A warning will appear when ordinary users attempt to read more than the set number of articles per month.

If the article is not set free by the owner, users cannot read it. But this is a soft paywall.

#### How do I read posts on Medium?

Simply open the same page in an incognito tab if you have reached your Medium article reading limit.

It is not possible for Medium to keep track of how many articles you have read. Nevertheless, even if he records it, he will not know that you are reading it.

A cookie or browser storage area is used to keep track of the number of reads. Consequently, if you open your browser in an incognito tab or delete cookies, your reading limit will be reset.

### 10. [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)

![Blogging site: Ghost](/posts/ghost.webp)

<TagList>
    <Tag color="blue">
        self-hosted option
    </Tag>
    <Tag color="sky">
        various theme and plugin options
    </Tag>
    <Tag color="cyan">
        paywall option
    </Tag>
    <Tag color="cyan">
        developer friendly
    </Tag>
</TagList>

Ghost is an **open source blogging site** that is popular among developers and writers. Its stars on GitHub indicate its popularity.

The most impressive feature of this platform, which is very popular with writers and programmers, is the content editor. In addition to having an embed button for a variety of platforms, this editor is also capable of working in markdown.

The bookmark tool is my favorite feature among all of these. You may also share your links as previews if you wish.

You can greatly enhance your blog's functionality with a variety of third-party integrations.

You may find the customization possibilities limited if you are not familiar with programming. A ready-made theme can be used in this situation. It is possible to find 40 - 50 free Ghost themes on the Internet. The cost of premium themes ranges from $49 to $89 per year.

On to the price part: Ghost's blog costs $29 if it is hosted on Ghost.org. As it is an open source project, you are free to customize your blog as you please, and you can host it wherever you wish. Alternatives that are less expensive are very likely to be found.

The fourth version of Ghost blogging site has brought a number of improvements and conveniences. Additionally, the $29 price mentioned above has been changed. A subscription to Ghost blog now costs $9 per year. The Ghost blogging platform has become very reasonable as a result of this.

### 11. [Tilda](https://tilda.cc/)

![Blogging site: Tilda](/posts/tilda.webp)

Blogging on Tilda is quite easy. You can write and edit blog posts with its visual editor, add images and videos, and share links to social media. You can also create custom web blocks and templates to give your blog a unique look, and you can use the CRM application to manage your customers and orders. Plus, you can export your code with an upper package to use on other platforms.

---

### 12. [Studio](https://studio.design)

![Blogging site: Studio](/posts/studio.webp)

Studio is a website creation platform based in Japan. The platform is very fast, and the user interface is almost awesome. As for the disadvantages, they allow you to publish up to 5 blog articles even in their $9 package. Consequently, we reach the $27 plan, the most expensive plan on this list. Corporate organizations may find this service to be ideal. In other words, it is more suitable for company blogs.

---

### 13. [Voog](https://www.voog.com/)

![Blogging site: Voog](/posts/voog.webp)

Among the features that Voog, a website builder, offers are those necessary to produce a well-written blog post. It is comparable to platforms such as Wix, Squarespace, and WordPress in this respect.

A free plan is available for this blog app, but the lowest plan costs between 8 and 11 euros. Blogging on the Voog platform is easy to use and provides a range of features for creating a professional-looking blog. It allows you to customize your blog with a range of themes and includes features such as adding images and videos, creating a comment section, and connecting to social media accounts.

---

### 14. [Strikingly](https://www.strikingly.com/)

![Blogging site: Strikingly](/posts/strikingly.webp)

Strikingly is a website building platform just like Wix and Squarespace. Although it has less features than its alternatives, it is among the free blog sites that you can use with a subdomain.

---

### 15. [Webnode](https://us.webnode.com/)

![Blogging site: Webnode](/posts/webnode.webp)

Blogging on the WebNode platform is simple and straightforward. You can customize the look of your blog, add posts, and upload images. You can also connect your blog to social media accounts, like Twitter and Facebook, and use SEO tools to get more exposure.

There is no free version of Webnode, but it does offer a reasonably priced $3.9 plan. Using Webnode, you can open a blog, an e-commerce site, or a company website. There is no free plan available with this blog app, so the lowest plan ranges from 8 - 11 euros.

---

### 16. [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/app/blog)

![Blogging site: Odoo](/posts/odoo-blog-1391x800.webp)

I would describe Odoo as an open source business suite. CRM, Purchasing, Contracts, Employee Tracking, Blog Writing, etc., are just a few of the applications included in this application suite.

The blog is the part of these applications that we are currently interested in. Furthermore, if you intend to use Odoo only for blogging, it is free.

In spite of the fact that I am not able to say it catches the current trends for its ready-made templates, I believe it deserves to be considered among the best free blogging sites.

---

### 17. [Ucraft](https://frstre.com/go/?a=35975-862da9&s=2633405-7f7428)

![Blogging site: Ucraft](/posts/ucraft.webp)

This platform was originated in Russia and has offices in three countries, including the United States. A number of e-commerce services are also offered by UCraft. Thus, it is suitable for bloggers who intend to sell their products. Although it is less well known than other examples, we can say that it is a suitable option for beginners who wish to start a blog.

With the lowest paid package of $10, you will be able to use the e-commerce service.

### 20. [Storipress](https://storipress.com/)

![Blogging site: Storipress](/posts/storipress.webp)

Storipress is one of the newest members of the list of best blogging sites. It was made available in the last days of October 2021. I have been anticipating its development for a very long time. Despite submitting a request for early access several years ago, the product has just been released into public beta. Here are my first impressions:

Using this application, which serves as a website builder for authors and publishers, you can easily customize the pages of your blog site. When you log in to the site, click on your profile on the top right and select the 'Builder' option, the necessary screen to create a web page will appear. By selecting a template on the left, you can customize your page.

You may recognize the editor of Storipress, one of these newest blogging sites. I believe they used the [MobileDoc blog editor](https://bustle.github.io/mobiledoc-kit/demo/), which is also used in Ghost blogs. However, it can be said that it is a little customized, although it is not the same.

It is worth noting, however, that this editor is also unable to mark links as "nofolow", which is a feature we are looking for.

The Storipress blog platform is best suited for large-scale posting organizations. Using this tool, you can collaborate with others and categorize your blog posts as "drafts", "for review", and "reviewed". As a result, you will be able to deal with large volumes of blog posts much more efficiently.

Depending on how many editors you need and the size of your team, it has a price policy that varies. Personal use is also subject to a $14 fee. In view of this price policy and its features, more suitable alternatives can be considered for personal use.

## Personal suggestions for choosing the right platform

Here are my suggestions, and you can think of them as "If I were you, what would I do":

- If I did not need ultra-complex requests and I wanted to gain the maximum out of almost every possibility and future need, I would [choose WordPress as my platform of choice](https://wordpress.com/).
- Considering that you are going to design and develop your own website or clone a website template from a designer, you would be better to [go with WebFlow if the design and animation are your top priority](https://webflow.grsm.io/gr15bvbdlvfo).
- Depending on whether I am a person who doesn't get hung up on details too much and I am looking for every feature possible at the least possible cost, I may choose [Wix](https://www.wix.com/) as my website builder.
- In the event that I am just going to write and I do not want to spend much time tweaking my site, but I need a pre-designed theme with a pleasing visual appeal, then [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) would be the best choice.
- If you are a person who likes to keep your notes on your local machine, and have no problems doing some technical configurations, I would suggest you use [Publii](https://getpublii.com/).
- In case you are a storyteller or you prefer to use more images than text and the price does not really matter to you, then [Exposure](https://exposure.co/) is for you.
- I would recommend [Vev](https://www.vev.design/) if the price is important to you, but you trust your creative skills and maybe you like experimental works a lot. 
- If you say that I'm a busy creative person, and my portfolio would be the killer thing than go with [CarbonMade](https://carbonmade.com/). 


Ultimately, the best blogging platform for you will depend on your individual needs and preferences. It's important to take the time to research different platforms and experiment with them to find the one that works best for you. With the right platform and a bit of creativity, anyone can create a successful and engaging blog.
