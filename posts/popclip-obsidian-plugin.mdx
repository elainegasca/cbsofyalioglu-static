![Popclip Obsidian Plugin](/posts/note-taking.webp)

I'm introducing the Popclip extension and Obsidian plugin that I built in a day. 

I've been using these tools extensively for a while now. I'm a big fan of Popclip and Obsidian. 

I'm using [Popclip](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/popclip/id445189367) to capture the text from the web and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to store my notes.

However, capturing text from the web and pasting it to Obsidian is a bit of a hassle. 

There are other tools that I've tried but either they are so expensive  for the value they create, or they are not working as I expected.

## What are the requirements?
- You need a Popclip app on your MacOS.
- You need an Obsidian app on your MacOS.


## How does it work?
There are two part of the workflow. 
- Installing the Popclip extension.
- Installing the Obsidian plugin. 

Both of those options are open-sourced and available on [Github](https://github.com/canburaks/obsidian-popclip).

## Part I: Installing the Popclip extension.

You can select the text below and your popclip automatically shows the installation option.

```YAML
# PopClip - Obsidian extension, markdown variant 
name: ObsidianClipper 
icon: O 
capture html: true
options: 
- identifier: "vault" 
  label: "Vault name" 
  type: string
- identifier: "path"
  label: "Location"
  type: string
javascript: | 
    const vaultName = encodeURIComponent(popclip.options.vault) 
    const fileLocation = encodeURIComponent(popclip.options.path)
    const data = {
      clipping: popclip.input.markdown,
      path: fileLocation || undefined,
    }
    let clipping = popclip.input.markdown 
    if (popclip.context.browserUrl.length > 0) { // append markdown source link if available 
      data["title"] = popclip.context.browserTitle
      data["source"] = popclip.context.browserUrl
    } 
    clipping = encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(data))
    popclip.openUrl(`obsidian://advanced-uri?vault=${vaultName}&daily=true&heading=popclip&data=%0A${clipping}&mode=append`) 
#end
```


## Part II: Installing the Obsidian plugin.

I didn't submit the plugin yet. Therefore, you need to install it manually.

1. Download GitHub repository of [Obsidian Popclip plugin](https://github.com/canburaks/obsidian-popclip).
2. Copy the `popclip` folder under "dist".
3. Paste the `popclip` folder under your Obsidian plugin folder.
4. Restart Obsidian.
